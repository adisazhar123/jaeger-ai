1. (DONE) insert to `traces` table and summarize
2. (DONE) summarize the spans
3. (DONE) create knowledge graph
    BUG:
    - while  creating the graph, there seems to be some relationship not added
    - for e.g. 88edbbb1e8ccf9d3 should be invoked by 97cafb8b8e8cb238
    - TO CHECK: maybe the write spans are not coming in sequentially?
    - bug is fized
4. [optional maybe] implement dependencystore/interface
